This package uses the Debian 3.0 (quilt) source package format.

The upstream tarball has been repacked to remove the compiled
Java archive lib/thread_safe/jruby_cache_backend.jar.

The removal has been done with git-buildpackage, during the import
of the upstream tarball via git import-orig command and its filter
option (see debian/gbp.conf).
